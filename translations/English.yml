It turned out that he considers it a simple but expensive trinket! Outrageous, kar! Only fools think so. In the old days, Heroes used the energy hidden in rubies to build GREAT ALTARS... But these stones are no longer the same... But I knew a couple of Vikings and Valkyries who tried to build it, but they didn't succeed. Maybe they had too few rubies? If you decide to try, I'll fly to Haldor and talk to him about selling rubies."
